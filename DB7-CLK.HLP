DB7-CLK.DBG
===========

        Forth-controlled clocking of data to DB7 using diagnostic mode

bbbb >>    } set bit pattern on SSI bus. bbbb = { CLK=1, ADR=2, STB=4, SDO=8 }

bbb0 ck>   } set ADR, STB and SDO=bbb, and pulse clock 0-1-0
addr a>db7 } clock out address (returns all lines to 0 after strobe)
data d>db7 } clock out data - 16 bits

data addr >db7 } complete write to DB7
