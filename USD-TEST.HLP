USD Instructions (BallScrew USD2.0)
===================================

Backlash measurements are done by comparing 10 readings of the unloaded USD
with 10 readings of the USD loaded with a 100ul syringe. The unloaded readings
are taken with a rubber band providing light tension, so that backlash is
prevented. This therefore measures the hysteresis of the optoswitch.

The optoswitch must be connected to channel 10 (Y axis LS input)

USD Test Words        - type <test> first
==============
sno b   } Does 10 hysteresis measurements, followed by 10 backlash measurements
        } and reports the means and the difference, which is the backlash.

sno s+  } moves syringe sno +0.05mm   eg   2 s+
sno s-  } moves syringe sno -0.05 mm
sno s++ } moves syringe sno +1.0 mm
sno s-- } moves syringe sno -1.0 mm
